## ‚ú® Overview
* **Community marketplace for help & items** ‚Äì post ads, browse nearby offers and start a chat with a single tap.  
* **Map‚Äëcentric UI** ‚Äì users pick an exact location when creating a listing, and the home screen shows ads around their current position (Google Maps SDK).  
* **Realtime backend** ‚Äì Firebase Authentication, Firestore, Storage and Cloud Messaging keep data and notifications in sync across devices.  
* **Cloud Functions micro‚Äëservices** ‚Äì small Node scripts (in `functions/`) handle server‚Äëside validation and scheduled clean‚Äëups.
